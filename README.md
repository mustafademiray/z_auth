Authorization Function for Partial Views

Function fits perfectly for the Fiori Search Help's.

Function feeds from two Z Tables.

UNAME - VKGRP - VKBUR

and

UNAME - PRDHA

If a user have ALL authorization in his/her row, he/she can view any material or customer on reports.

Ask me anything about function here with issues or mail me with: mustafademiray@protonmail.com
